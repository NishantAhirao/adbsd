Pandas:
Pandas is a library that provides data structures and data analysis tools. It introduces two primary data structures: Series and DataFrame.

Series: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type. It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a single-column dataset.
DataFrame: A two-dimensional labeled data structure consisting of columns that can hold different data types. It is akin to a spreadsheet or a SQL table.
Pandas provides a wide range of functionalities for data manipulation, cleaning, filtering, merging, grouping, and analysis. It allows for efficient handling of structured data and makes data exploration and manipulation tasks more convenient.

NumPy:
NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a library for numerical computation in Python. It provides a multidimensional array object called ndarray, along with functions for working with arrays efficiently.

The key features of NumPy include:

ndarray: A fast and efficient n-dimensional array object that supports various operations, including mathematical, logical, and statistical operations.
Vectorized operations: NumPy enables element-wise operations on arrays, allowing for concise and efficient computation on large datasets.
Linear algebra operations: NumPy provides functions for linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
Random number generation: NumPy includes functions for generating random numbers from various probability distributions.
Integration with other libraries: NumPy serves as the foundation for many other scientific and data-related Python libraries, including Pandas, SciPy, and scikit-learn.
NumPy's efficient array operations and mathematical functions make it a fundamental library for scientific computing and data analysis in Python.



# how to convert categorical variables into quantitative variables in python

# Categorical variables represent qualitative characteristics or attributes. They divide data into distinct categories or groups.
# Examples: Examples of categorical variables include gender (male or female)

# Quantitative variables represent numerical quantities or measurements. They provide information about the magnitude or amount of something.
# Examples: Examples of quantitative variables include age (in years)
