Pandas:
    Pandas is a library that provides data structures and data analysis tools. It introduces two primary data structures: Series and DataFrame.

    Series: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type. It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a single-column dataset.
    DataFrame: A two-dimensional labeled data structure consisting of columns that can hold different data types. It is akin to a spreadsheet or a SQL table.
    Pandas provides a wide range of functionalities for data manipulation, cleaning, filtering, merging, grouping, and analysis. It allows for efficient handling of structured data and makes data exploration and manipulation tasks more convenient.

NumPy:
    NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a library for numerical computation in Python. It provides a multidimensional array object called ndarray, along with functions for working with arrays efficiently.

    The key features of NumPy include:

    ndarray: A fast and efficient n-dimensional array object that supports various operations, including mathematical, logical, and statistical operations.
    Vectorized operations: NumPy enables element-wise operations on arrays, allowing for concise and efficient computation on large datasets.
    Linear algebra operations: NumPy provides functions for linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
    Random number generation: NumPy includes functions for generating random numbers from various probability distributions.
    Integration with other libraries: NumPy serves as the foundation for many other scientific and data-related Python libraries, including Pandas, SciPy, and scikit-learn.
    NumPy's efficient array operations and mathematical functions make it a fundamental library for scientific computing and data analysis in Python.


Seaborn is a popular data visualization library in Python built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn is designed to work seamlessly with pandas data structures and is particularly well-suited for visualizing complex datasets.

Seaborn offers a wide range of plotting functions and customization options, making it easy to create various types of statistical visualizations.


index_col for taking a column as index else default from 0 to n

The value_counts() method is a function provided by pandas that is used to count the occurrences of unique values in a pandas Series. It returns a new Series object with the unique values as the index and their corresponding counts as the values.
