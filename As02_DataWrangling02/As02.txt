#Scipy.stats:  provides a wide range of statistical functions and distributions for various probability distributions, statistical tests, and descriptive statistics.

matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of functions in the matplotlib library that provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating various types of plots and visualizations in Python. It is a commonly used module for generating 2D plots

#The z-score :, also known as the standard score, measures how many standard deviations a particular value is away from the mean of a distribution. z = (x - mean) / std

 pd.read_csv() : that is used to read data from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file into a pandas DataFrame.


#calculates the interquartile range (IQR) for a given array of values. The IQR is a measure of statistical dispersion, specifically the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles of a distribution.
# The formula for calculating the IQR is: IQR = Q3 - Q1
# Q1 is the 25th percentile (the value below which 25% of the data falls).
# Q3 is the 75th percentile (the value below which 75% of the data falls).
#  It returns a scalar value representing the IQR.


sklearn.preprocessing is a module in the scikit-learn (sklearn) library that provides a collection of tools for data preprocessing and feature engineering. It offers various functions and classes to transform, normalize, encode, and scale input data

LabelEncoder class provides a convenient way to transform these categorical labels into numeric labels 
The LabelEncoder works by assigning a unique integer value to each unique label in the input data. For example, if the input labels are ["red", "blue", "green", "red"], the LabelEncoder will assign the values [0, 1, 2, 0] to them.

fit_transform: combines the steps of fitting a model or transformer to the data and transforming the data in a single step
Fit: During the fitting phase, the model or transformer learns and adapts to the input data
Transform: After the fitting phase, the transform() method is applied to the input data using the learned parameters or statistics.

plt.scatter(a,b): It is used to create scatter plots, a type of plot that displays individual data points as markers on a 2D Cartesian coordinate system.
